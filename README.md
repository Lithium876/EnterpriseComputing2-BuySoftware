## Application requirements:
1. Students must develop ASP.NET multipage application using MS SQL Server 2013/2014 database and Visual Studio 2015/17 Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

2. The name of the application and database must consist of only the student’s ID. The penalty for not fulfilling this requirement is zero (0) for entire assignment.
